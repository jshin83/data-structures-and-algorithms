# Challenge Summary

## Challenge Description
The insertShiftArray method takes in an array and the value to be added. 
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to java, 
the function returns an array with the new value added at the middle index.
## Approach & Efficiency
The function checks for edge cases and handles them.
I use a loop where there is a conditional to see if the index
equals the middle. The middle is determined by a conditional statement
that checks to see the input array length is odd or even.
Time complexity of is O(N) as the original array must be iterated
one time.
Space complexity is O(N), as a new array of N + 1, is used.
